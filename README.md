# Neural Networks Basics

For quite some time now, I wanted to get a better understanding of neural networks - how they are programmed, how they work, and what the theoretical foundation for them looks like. 
As keeping track of all the information and resources I have been reading and using over the years became increasingly difficult, I decided to create these notebooks.
Their aim is to outline the basic principles of different types of neural networks and to provide examples of what they can be used for.

Currently, the notebooks cover perceptrons, feed-forward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and LSTM.
